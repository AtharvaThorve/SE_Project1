## Analysis:

The way we discover and enjoy films has been completely transformed by movie recommender systems, which are frequently hailed as the heroes of the digital entertainment era. These advanced algorithms incorporate information from our viewing habits, tastes, and even user collaboration to provide us with tailored movie recommendations. Movie recommender systems have evolved into important tools in this age of abundant content, leading us through the enormous cinematic landscape to help us select the ideal movie for any mood and situation. This introduction lays the groundwork for a discussion of these systems' operation, the effects they have on the entertainment business, and how they influence how we view films.
We chose the Project of movie recommendations because the project was quite exciting and in our opinion, we would be able to incorporate new features into the already existing software.

We faced severe difficulties while using the Git repository to manage the project. Our initial impression of the repository was that it lacked a visually appealing design and that important metrics were missing. The absence of social media links or other platforms where we might ask questions or raise concerns about the product was another thing we observed. Furthermore, it was discovered that the repository's maintainers had not taken any steps to address and close a number of issues dated back to 2020. Diving deep into the source code we could see that there are no License and contribution rights added to the header of the source code files. Though the software is simple to use, it didn’t include any quick start guide for other users to follow. While skimming through the docs we noticed that they are not very well formulated and do not follow the guidelines of documentation styles. While trying to run the software we also encountered the problem of dependencies. Their repo is not updated and uses the old versions and while installing we had to manually install everything. Moreover, the software does not include any automation deployment tools to help streamline the process. One good thing about the software is that it includes CI/CD practices but while looking at the tests we thought that more rigorous testing could have been done both manually and automatically. On a positive note, we can see that the project is running as and we are able to get the expected results from the software.

While the discussed bottlenecks sound more operational than logical, they accumulate to give us an inferior user experience. We would like to start revamping the layout, make it more visually appealing, and have well-defined headings, and subsections with all the necessary links and appropriate formatting. Suggestions, recommendations, and timely addressing of the concerns are quintessential, hence, we would be adding links to the project's social media profiles, and communication channels (e.g. discord) where users and contributors can interact with us. We would be setting up clear issue templates to encourage contributors to provide relevant information when reporting issues, and include your copyright notice at the beginning of each source file, and a copy of the entire license somewhere in the source tree. The installation section needs to be reworked to create a smooth user/developer experience, hence, we would be incrementing the installation section, and also adding the project’s social media pages in case a developer is still not able to work things out. We also plan to containerize our work into docker instances - this would make the application truly portable as a user would not have to worry about the system on which the code needs to run, it would also help in a more efficient use of system resources, it would also help in a smooth development process as we can save the container state in docker which would be very helpful while troubleshooting. The user interface of the application can be more fluid for a user, hence, we will be aiming to visually improve it, there is also scope for improving the collaborative filtering model as can be seen in the code, we would like to achieve it by further optimizing the training parameters and increasing the training data, thereby giving better recommendations to a user.
